Hey there! 👋

I’m **GIBBONE**, a web developer based in Italy…
I design and build **clean, fast, and highly polished web experiences** — with a focus on **advanced graphics, smooth animations, and modern interfaces**…

If an idea pops into my head… **chances are I’ll build it and ship it**.

My main tech stack includes:

* **JavaScript, TypeScript**
* **React, Next.js**
* **CSS / SCSS**
* **GSAP**
* **Node.js**

I also use tools like **Figma, Git**, and modern build systems such as **Vite**…
---
**What I create:**

* Modern, high-performance websites…
* Carefully crafted and animated UIs…
* Full frontend + backend web apps…
* Clean designs with obsessive attention to detail…

You can explore my **portfolio**, where I showcase my best projects, concepts, and experiments — the place where I display everything I’m proud of.

I’ve built several public and private projects…
And I’m always working on something new…
